QUESTION:

I am working on an enterprise integration software project, and we are using
Solace PubSub+ message broker. There are 4 important variables that needs to be
used when an app needs to establish a connection with the broker:

- user
- password
- url
- vpn

I have the user, password and url, but I do not have the vpn.
How is the way to set up a value for the vpn?


ANSWER:

To set up a value for the VPN (Virtual Private Network) in Solace PubSub+, you
need to configure a Message VPN on your event broker. A Message VPN is a logical
entity that segregates topic spaces and clients, ensuring that messages
published within a particular group are only visible to that group's clients.

Here are the steps to set up a basic Message VPN:

1. Access the Solace CLI: Connect to your Solace PubSub+ event broker using the
command line interface (CLI).

2. Enable Configuration Mode:

solace> enable
solace# configure

1. Create and Configure the Message VPN:

solace(configure)# message-vpn <vpn-name>
solace(configure/message-vpn)# no shutdown

1. Set Up Client Username for the VPN:

solace(configure)# client-username <username> message-vpn <vpn-name>
solace(configure/client-username)# no shutdown

1. Save the Configuration:

solace(configure/client-username)# end

Replace <vpn-name> with your desired VPN name and <username> with the client
username you want to use. This will create and activate a Message VPN that you
can use in your application configuration

If you need more detailed instructions or have specific requirements,
the Solace documentation provides comprehensive guidance.

message-vpn vpn-popcorn
no shutdown
client-username admin message-vpn vpn-popcorn
no shutdown
end

I have tried the first command you sent me. It did not work:

ef70c4903070(configure)# message-vpn vpn-popcorn
ERROR:  Cannot enter message-vpn mode: not found.
ef70c4903070(configure)#

Please advise.

====

It looks like the command didn't work because the message-vpn mode wasn't found.
This could be due to a few reasons:

1. Permissions: Ensure that your user has the necessary permissions to create
and configure Message VPNs.

2. Default VPN: Some Solace PubSub+ event brokers come with a default Message
VPN named default. You might need to enable and configure this default VPN
instead of creating a new one.

3. Software Version: Verify that your Solace PubSub+ software version supports
the creation of Message VPNs. Some versions or configurations might have
limitations.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

Check Permissions

Ensure that your user has administrative privileges to create and manage
Message VPNs.

Enable Default VPN

If the default VPN is available, you can enable and use it:

solace> enable
solace# configure
solace(configure)# message-vpn default
solace(configure/message-vpn)# no shutdown

Verify Software Version

Make sure your Solace PubSub+ event broker version supports Message VPNs.
You can check the documentation or contact Solace support for more details.

Use Solace PubSub+ Manager

You can also use the Solace PubSub+ Manager (web interface) to create and manage
Message VPNs. This might provide a more user-friendly way to configure your VPN.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, please provide more details about your
setup, and I'll be happy to assist further!
