Loading Solace code from GitHub

There are 4 Solace main repositories in GitHub: labs, products, samples and training:

    https://github.com/SolaceLabs
    https://github.com/SolaceProducts
    https://github.com/SolaceSamples
    https://github.com/SolaceTraining

I created 4 shell scripts to load all projects from these 4 repositories (except for SourceLabs â€“ I decided to cherry-pick 49 projects from the list of 79).

Make sure you have git installed in your Mac, or git-bash installed in your Windows machine.

The scripts are:

    clone-labs.sh
    clone-products.sh
    clone-samples.sh
    clone-training.sh

Create these 4 folders:

    ~/dev/workspace/solace/labs
    ~/dev/workspace/solace/products
    ~/dev/workspace/solace/samples
    ~/dev/workspace/solace/training

Copy each script to the correspondent folder.

If you are using Mac, you may need to run

dos2unix clone-labs.sh

Open a shell console and make and make sure the script is executable by running:

chmod a+x clone-labs.sh

Then you run the command by typing:

./clone-labs.sh

Do this for each of the 4 scripts saved in the 4 different folders.
