port 8080 — Use this port when configuring the message broker container with Solace PubSub+ Broker Manager.

port 55555 (Windows | Linux) / port 55554 (Mac OS) — Your applications can
           use Solace APIs to connect to the message broker on this port.
		   Note that for Mac users we are mapping port 55554 to the
		   default Solace SMF port of 55555 because Mac OS now reserves port 55555.
		   
port 8008 — The JavaScript sample applications below use this port to pass Web Messaging traffic through the message broker.

ports 1883 & 8000 — Ports for MQTT connectivity, over TCP and over WebSockets respectively

port 5672 — AMQP 1.0 applications using Apache QPID APIs would connect here

port 9000 — Use REST to send messaging and event data with Solace’s RESTful API port

port 2222 — Use SSH to connect to the Solace Command Line Interface (CLI) for advanced configuration

(4) I have this configuration for ports:

		localhost:55554:55555(TCP)

What does the first and the second number mean?

In the configuration localhost:55554:55555(TCP), the numbers represent different ports used for network communication:

•  55554: This is the local port on your machine. It is the port that your local application will use to send or receive data.

•  55555: This is the remote port on the destination machine. It is the port that the remote application will use to send or receive data.

Essentially, this configuration sets up a connection where data sent from port 55554 on your local machine is directed to port 55555 on the remote machine, using the TCP protocol.
