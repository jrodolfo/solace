What are the possible values for properties of the Solace Event Broker messages?

Solace Event Broker messages have several properties that can be set to control
their behavior and routing. Here are some key properties and their possible values:

1. Time-to-Live (TTL): This property sets the lifespan of a message in milliseconds.
   A value of 0 means the message never expires.

2. Dead Message Queue (DMQ) Eligibility: Messages can be flagged as eligible for
   a Dead Message Queue if they exceed their TTL or maximum redelivery attempts.

3. Eliding Eligibility: This property determines if a message can be elided
   (i.e., skipped) under certain conditions to optimize bandwidth.

4. Partition Key: Used to ensure messages with the same key are routed to the
   same partition, maintaining order.

These properties help manage how messages are handled, ensuring efficient and reliable
message delivery within your event-driven architecture.
