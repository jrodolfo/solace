	How to see the messages?

QUESTION 01

I am using Solace PubSub+ that is running inside a Docker container. I want to
see the messages that my Java app is publishing. I do no see any message in the
web interface. Is there a way to see these messages?

ANSWER 01

To view the messages that your Java application is publishing to Solace PubSub+
running inside a Docker container, you can use the following methods:

1. Solace CLI: You can access the Solace CLI from within the Docker container to
monitor messages. Use the following commands to enter the container:

docker ps
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash

Once inside, you can use Solace CLI commands to view messages.

1. Solace PubSub+ Manager: Ensure that the web interface is correctly configured
to display the messages. You might need to check the subscription settings and
ensure that the correct topic is being monitored.

2. Logging: Enable logging within the Solace PubSub+ container to capture
message activity. You can configure logging settings to output message details
to a log file.

3. Solace SDK: Use the Solace SDK for Java to create a subscriber application
that listens to the same topic your publisher is using. This can help you verify
that messages are being published correctly.

4. Docker Logs: Check the Docker logs for any errors or messages related to your
Solace container:

docker logs <container_id>

If you continue to have issues, ensure that your Java application is correctly
configured to publish messages to the expected topic and that there are no
network issues preventing communication between your application and the Solace
PubSub+ broker.

QUESTION 02

You mentioned that once I enter the container using the command:

	docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash

I should be able to use Solace CLI commands to view messages.

What are these commands?

ANSWER 02

Once you are inside the Docker container running Solace PubSub+, you can use the
Solace CLI to view messages. Here are some useful commands:

1. Log in to the CLI:

	cli -A

2. Show client connections:

	show client

3. Show message spool statistics:

	show message-spool

4. Show queue details:

	show queue <queue_name>

5. Show subscriptions:

	show subscription

6. Monitor messages on a specific topic:

	show topic <topic_name>

These commands will help you monitor and troubleshoot the messages being
published and received by your Solace PubSub+ broker
