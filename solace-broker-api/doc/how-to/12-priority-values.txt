What are the priority values for the Solace Event Broker messages?

Solace Event Brokers support ten levels of message priority, ranging from 0 (lowest priority) to 9 (highest priority).

If a message does not have a priority field, it is treated as priority 4 by default.

This priority system helps ensure that higher-priority messages are delivered before lower-priority ones, optimizing the
message flow based on importance.
