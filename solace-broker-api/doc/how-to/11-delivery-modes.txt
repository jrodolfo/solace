What are the deliveryMode for the Solace Event Broker messages?

Solace Event Brokers support several message delivery modes, each suited for different use cases:

1. Direct Messaging: This mode is designed for high-speed applications that can tolerate occasional message loss.
   Messages are delivered to consumers with matching topic subscriptions but are not persisted on the event broker.

2. Persistent (Guaranteed) Messaging: This mode ensures that messages are never lost. Messages are saved in the event
   broker's message spool before being acknowledged back to the producers. This mode is used when data must be received
   by the consuming application, even if they are offline.

3. Non-Persistent Messaging: This mode is used to fulfill JMS specification requirements and is similar to persistent
   messaging in function but without the persistence guarantee.

4. Transacted Delivery: This mode supports session-based and XA transactions, ensuring that a series of operations are
   completed successfully before being committed.

Each mode offers different levels of reliability and performance, allowing you to choose the best option for your
specific application needs.
